* **subject**: integer value represents one of the 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years who carried out the experiments.
* **activity**: string value represents one of six the activities performed by a volunteer; the values of any activity can be one of the following :(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
* The rest of the varibales are 86 measurements representing the mean and the standard deviation of the following signals used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions); **the values of these measuremente are aggreagted by the average (mean) of each activity and each subject, these values are not representing a single observation**:
